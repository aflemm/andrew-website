    <richText>Check chedda like a food inspecta&#x2019;, here is my first blog:&#xD;&#xD;So I have been a little behind on these blog entries. Im sorry, this is all new for me. Our first spiel has come and gone and we have had some success - we won! In the Pitaburrow we met Ed&#x2019;s mom; she is a French riot, just like the ones in Montreal when the Canadiens score a goal. She Hooked us up with some fine cooking, but would not let us stop eating.. &#xD;&#xD;Had two run-ins with the U of Ottawa girls soccer team and soccer has never looked so appealing. Whoever invented LuLu lemon is okay in my books.&#xD;&#xD;After winning, Andy, Ed, Willburforce and I each got a Wendy&#x2019;s frosty... While Brandon took a 1am bus ride back to Ottawa. &#xA0;He rolled in to the capitol just around 6am for his morning class. Back in &#x201C;the loo,&#x201D; we all woke up to news that a twenty-year old was stabbed on a greyhound that night... YIKES! We weren&#x2019;t too concerned because he is just the lead, but imagine if it was me! </richText>
