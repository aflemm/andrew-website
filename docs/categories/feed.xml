I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying since it debuted that Patriot is the best thing on TV, and as much as I adore Ted Lasso, six years later my opinion hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The acting is wonderful, the story is exciting, but the dialog is what really pushes it over the edge. The way the characters speak is so wonderfully weird. The odd cadence, the repetition, it feels carefully crafted in a way that just sticks in your brain. It&amp;rsquo;s a damned shame it got shit-canned by Amazon, but the seasons that were made are such perfection that I&amp;rsquo;m not even mad about it. Seriously, just watch this show.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks ago I saw a car accident - two people went through an intersection at the same time. Both slammed on their brakes at the same time and collided. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But then it occurred to me - if they had just gone through the intersection, they wouldn’t have collided. The brakes CAUSED the accident!&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Bill] Murray is always right for a role in an Anderson film, and I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s because they share a bemused sadness. You can&amp;rsquo;t easily imagine Murray playing a manic or a cut-up; his eyes, which have always been old eyes, look upon the world and waver between concern and disappointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In Anderson&amp;rsquo;s films, there is a sort of resignation to the underlying melancholy of the world; he is the only American director I can think of whose work reflects the Japanese concept mono no aware, which describes a wistfulness about the transience of things.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The correct tone for the Bond films was established right at the start, with Sean Connery&amp;rsquo;s quizzical eyebrows and sardonic smile. He understood that the Bond character was so preposterous that only lightheartedness could save him. The moment Bond began to act like a real man in a real world, all was lost.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For homeopaths, the only purpose of clinical research is to validate what they already “know” – it is a statistical crap shoot of placebo vs placebo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Another researcher, reports Betz, was confused when the placebo control he used in his clinical trial had the same effect as the homeopathic remedy being tested. Instead of concluding that his study was negative, he instead concluded that since the placebo was stored in the same refrigerator as the remedy, that the homeopathic drug was radiating it effective quality to the placebo. Despite sealing the placebos in aluminum foil and separating them from the homeopathic remedy in different refrigerators, this homeopathic researcher could still not keep the effect of the drug from leaking over into the placebo.&lt;/p>
