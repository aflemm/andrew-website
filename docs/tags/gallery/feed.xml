&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is the awful feeling that the world has moved on. The White House blithely anticipates a “&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/joe-biden-warns-winter-death-070719247.html">winter of death&lt;/a>” and suffering for the unvaccinated, but, well, that’s their own fault, isn’t it! If you’re fully vaxxed, which you of course could be, omicron will be a sniffle and a five-day reality TV binge! &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/covid-omicron-vaccination-rashomon/621199/">The Atlantic writes&lt;/a> of reasonable people saying they’re “vaxxed and done,” people who reasonably say “COVID is becoming something like the seasonal flu for most people who keep up with their shots,” as if everyone has the option of shots to keep up with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to scream. If I can scream, for a second? &lt;em>The pandemic is not fucking over, because children under 5 cannot get fucking vaccinated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In a way it&amp;rsquo;s even worse for those of us with kids under 2. From an &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-ongoing-studies-covid-19">update given last December by Pfizer&lt;/a> regarding the status of clinical trials for children:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Compared to the 16- to 25-year-old population in which high efficacy was demonstrated, &lt;strong>non-inferiority was met for the 6- to 24-month-old population&lt;/strong> but not for the 2- to under 5-year-old population in this analysis. No safety concerns were identified and the 3 µg dose demonstrated a favorable [&lt;em>sic&lt;/em>] safety profile in children 6 months to under 5 years of age. [Emphasis added]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We have a &lt;em>safe and effective&lt;/em> vaccine for the 6-month to 2-year-old population, we&amp;rsquo;ve had it for over a month now, but we&amp;rsquo;re not rolling it out because &amp;hellip; we simply can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered? Pardon me while &lt;em>I&lt;/em> scream for a second.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What kills me, what makes this such a struggle, what makes this endless waiting such a struggle, is that the question of a vaccine for my kid has left the arena of science and entered the fields of business and politics. Before December, before this Pfizer report, there was a problem being worked by scientists — developing and testing a safe and effective vaccine. A noble effort that you could have some comfort waiting for. It was hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once they solved it though, once they solved that hard problem, a business (Pfizer) decided that separate regulatory filings for two age groups would be too onerous, surely more profitable to wait and group all under 5&amp;rsquo;s together. Our governments also decided there was no point in applying pressure to get this unimportant age bracket of under-2&amp;rsquo;s vaccinated. The fact is, kids this age hardly ever hold &lt;em>jobs&lt;/em> anyway, so what&amp;rsquo;s the point? Whether they&amp;rsquo;re sick or healthy, they&amp;rsquo;re not generating profit for the the ruling class, so &amp;hellip; what&amp;rsquo;s the point?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re just supposed to accept that our kids will inevitably get COVID without being vaccinated because protecting them would simply be too much effort for us to collectively muster. Get back to normal, open the bars, cary on. The economic engine has been sufficiently protected, that&amp;rsquo;s good enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, they &lt;em>probably&lt;/em> won&amp;rsquo;t end up in the hospital, and they &lt;em>probably&lt;/em> won&amp;rsquo;t die — that should be comfort enough, right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bumper Sticker Design</title><link>https://andrewflemming.net/blog/2021/bumper-sticker-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andrewflemming.net/blog/2021/bumper-sticker-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://andrewflemming.net/images/blog/2021/fucking-bumper-sticker.png" alt="bumper sticker">&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She had to take her excellent but limited skillset and apply it to this problem&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love this — &lt;em>excellent but limited&lt;/em>. This character was really good at killing people with swords, and when faced with a problem she needed to solve, this limited skillset was what she had available. No matter how excellent this skillset was, it was never going to solve the problem &amp;hellip; cleanly. Had she been a little more skilled at making persuasive phone calls, or something similar, she probably could have handled the situation with less loss of life, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a choice she was able to make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We may not all be ninja warrior nuns, but I think this is a (the??) universal life experience — solving problems with our own limited (hopefully excellent, occasionally) skillset. I think you can view anyone&amp;rsquo;s actions through this lens and gain at least some insight into what is driving their choices.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying since it debuted that Patriot is the best thing on TV, and as much as I adore Ted Lasso, six years later my opinion hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The acting is wonderful, the story is exciting, but the dialog is what pushes it over the edge for me. The way the characters speak is so wonderfully weird. The odd cadence, the repetition, the repetition of specific words &amp;hellip; it feels carefully crafted in a way that just sticks in your brain. It&amp;rsquo;s a damned shame it got shit-canned by Amazon, but the seasons that were made are such perfection that I&amp;rsquo;m not even mad about it. Seriously, just watch this show. It&amp;rsquo;s cool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paradise, Provence</title><link>https://andrewflemming.net/blog/2018/paradise-provence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 08:59:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andrewflemming.net/blog/2018/paradise-provence/</guid><description>&lt;p>This family trip to France was one of the best we&amp;rsquo;ve taken, but when we got home I realized I had taken less than 5 videos the whole time.

&lt;p>In the end I stripped out the videos from all the live photos taken on my phone, and was able to cobble this together. A disappointment as a piece of work, but a wonderful reminder of an incredible week.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[Bill] Murray is always right for a role in an Anderson film, and I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s because they share a bemused sadness. You can&amp;rsquo;t easily imagine Murray playing a manic or a cut-up; his eyes, which have always been old eyes, look upon the world and waver between concern and disappointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In Anderson&amp;rsquo;s films, there is a sort of resignation to the underlying melancholy of the world; he is the only American director I can think of whose work reflects the Japanese concept mono no aware, which describes a wistfulness about the transience of things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For homeopaths, the only purpose of clinical research is to validate what they already “know” – it is a statistical crap shoot of placebo vs placebo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Another researcher, reports Betz, was confused when the placebo control he used in his clinical trial had the same effect as the homeopathic remedy being tested. Instead of concluding that his study was negative, he instead concluded that since the placebo was stored in the same refrigerator as the remedy, that the homeopathic drug was radiating it effective quality to the placebo. Despite sealing the placebos in aluminum foil and separating them from the homeopathic remedy in different refrigerators, this homeopathic researcher could still not keep the effect of the drug from leaking over into the placebo.&lt;/p>
