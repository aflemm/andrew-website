Check was an iPad and iPhone list manager that was as simple as it was beautiful. Set in Futura, on simulated stacks of paper, even the most mundane lists came to life as works of art. Finally, your lists could be beautiful.
Check would sync your lists between your devices using Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud service. So wherever you are, you could have your shopping lists, to-do lists, bucket lists, or whatever other list you could think of.</description></item><item><title>CurlBook</title><link>https://andrewflemming.net/projects/curlbook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewflemming.net/projects/curlbook/</guid><description>From its release in 2009 to its retirement in 2018 CurlBook was the premier curling coaching software for iOS, used around the world by national teams, including Curling Canada.

You enter grievances all year, and they remain hidden from everyone - even yourself. Keep all that anger bottled up until Festivus dinner and the airing of the grievances!
