&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I’m amazed they let me do this episode as I ended up writing it, because it’s so unbelievably, heartbreakingly sad,” Gendel said. “Picard did have a wife, he did have children, he did have a family and they’re all fucking dead.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>A few weeks ago I saw a car accident - two people went through an intersection at the same time. Both slammed on their brakes at the same time and collided. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But then it occurred to me - if they had just gone through the intersection, they wouldn’t have collided. The brakes CAUSED the accident!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bill] Murray is always right for a role in an Anderson film, and I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s because they share a bemused sadness. You can&amp;rsquo;t easily imagine Murray playing a manic or a cut-up; his eyes, which have always been old eyes, look upon the world and waver between concern and disappointment.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>In Anderson&amp;rsquo;s films, there is a sort of resignation to the underlying melancholy of the world; he is the only American director I can think of whose work reflects the Japanese concept mono no aware, which describes a wistfulness about the transience of things.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The correct tone for the Bond films was established right at the start, with Sean Connery&amp;rsquo;s quizzical eyebrows and sardonic smile. He understood that the Bond character was so preposterous that only lightheartedness could save him. The moment Bond began to act like a real man in a real world, all was lost.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For homeopaths, the only purpose of clinical research is to validate what they already “know” – it is a statistical crap shoot of placebo vs placebo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Another researcher, reports Betz, was confused when the placebo control he used in his clinical trial had the same effect as the homeopathic remedy being tested. Instead of concluding that his study was negative, he instead concluded that since the placebo was stored in the same refrigerator as the remedy, that the homeopathic drug was radiating it effective quality to the placebo. Despite sealing the placebos in aluminum foil and separating them from the homeopathic remedy in different refrigerators, this homeopathic researcher could still not keep the effect of the drug from leaking over into the placebo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I created Check in the summer of 2011, and maintained it until its retirement in 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check was an iPad and iPhone list manager that was as simple as it was beautiful. Set in Futura, on simulated stacks of paper, even the most mundane lists came to life as works of art. Finally, your lists could be beautiful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check would sync your lists between your devices using Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud service. So wherever you are, you could have your shopping lists, to-do lists, bucket lists, or whatever other list you could think of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="check-combo.png" alt="Check screenshots">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Check, you could email your lists to friends, families, bosses, Mothers-in-law, doctors, engineers, curling coaches &amp;hellip; and the list went on!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You would be amazed as Check makes you at least 6,000 times more efficient in every aspect of your day-to-day life!&lt;/em>*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Your jaw would feel excruciating pain, as it dropped to the floor when Check made you new friends, and gave you more power over old ones.&lt;/em>*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You’d look back on your pre-Check life as a distant ghost of a reflection of a dream, as you became a stronger, smarter, faster, sexier version of yourself than you ever thought possible.&lt;/em>*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>A mind-numbing satisfaction would take hold, when you realized that you are better than over 99% of the population&lt;/em>*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Check did all of these things, and more.†&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>*Results not typical&lt;/p>
