&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I’m amazed they let me do this episode as I ended up writing it, because it’s so unbelievably, heartbreakingly sad,” Gendel said. “Picard did have a wife, he did have children, he did have a family and they’re all fucking dead.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Now we’ve got nutjobs galore deciding not to vaccinate their kids based on advice from such medical experts as the guy whose brother knows a lady whose yoga instructor’s barista got vaccinated—and now she’s allergic to artisanal honey and hugs.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>A few weeks ago I saw a car accident - two people went through an intersection at the same time. Both slammed on their brakes at the same time and collided. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But then it occurred to me - if they had just gone through the intersection, they wouldn’t have collided. The brakes CAUSED the accident!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bill] Murray is always right for a role in an Anderson film, and I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s because they share a bemused sadness. You can&amp;rsquo;t easily imagine Murray playing a manic or a cut-up; his eyes, which have always been old eyes, look upon the world and waver between concern and disappointment.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>In Anderson&amp;rsquo;s films, there is a sort of resignation to the underlying melancholy of the world; he is the only American director I can think of whose work reflects the Japanese concept mono no aware, which describes a wistfulness about the transience of things.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The correct tone for the Bond films was established right at the start, with Sean Connery&amp;rsquo;s quizzical eyebrows and sardonic smile. He understood that the Bond character was so preposterous that only lightheartedness could save him. The moment Bond began to act like a real man in a real world, all was lost.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For homeopaths, the only purpose of clinical research is to validate what they already “know” – it is a statistical crap shoot of placebo vs placebo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Another researcher, reports Betz, was confused when the placebo control he used in his clinical trial had the same effect as the homeopathic remedy being tested. Instead of concluding that his study was negative, he instead concluded that since the placebo was stored in the same refrigerator as the remedy, that the homeopathic drug was radiating it effective quality to the placebo. Despite sealing the placebos in aluminum foil and separating them from the homeopathic remedy in different refrigerators, this homeopathic researcher could still not keep the effect of the drug from leaking over into the placebo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>There is no such thing as “alternative” medicine. There is medicine that has been proven safe and effective through science; there is medicine that has not.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
