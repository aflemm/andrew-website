    <richText>So we played about a thousand games in Coakville, and hit up this stellar coffee joint after most of them. &#xA0;I think it was called &#x201C;bean tree&#x201D;, or &#x201C;green bean&#x201D;, or &#x201C;green trees&#x201D; or maybe &#x201C;pot of gold&#x201D;... nonetheless they made some fine mocha-chinos and Brandon (he&#x2019;s alive) enjoyed his Nutty Irishmen. Who wouldn&#x2019;t?&#xD;&#xD;Big Shout Out to the Fanset team. I got two of their numbers! Who would&#x2019;ve thought we were capable of making new friends. &#xD;&#xD;So we trekked to my Aunts house and got all set up with free beds. Marlon-Brandon and I got to share the pullout couch and everything was fine until someone started grinding coffee at 1am.&#xD;&#xD;I think Willy lost some more hair watching us on Sunday, so some rest that night did us good. All in All another fine weekend and the team is gellin&#x2019; like we&#x2019;re wearing Dr. Scholls.</richText>
