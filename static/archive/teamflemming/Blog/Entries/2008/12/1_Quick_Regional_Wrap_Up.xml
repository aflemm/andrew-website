    <richText>Saturday: check.  &#x2028;A side final vs our boy Terry on Sunday.  After Lil Wayne got me Jacked and brandon did his lame girly stretching we took the ice ready for battle.  Hey, sometimes the bad guy wins.. look at the Lion King when Mufassa dies!&#xD;&#x2028;So the B final was another epic battle circa 1979-- pre free guard zone.  It was a battle of who was going to blink first. Luckily Will-T-Lettuce glued our eyelids open. Eight blanks and a final score of 2-1 showed everyone why curling doesn&#x2019;t have very much fan support. &#xD;&#xD;Also shout out to Hodgson rockin B-side. They will own the girls side in Ganknock.&#xD;&#xD;Weather left us stuck in Collingwood so we munched all you can eat chicken wings and crashed at Casa Nash again.  Another Huge thanks to them for their hospitality.&#xD;&#xD;God of War&#x2028;May your Hammer be mighty.&#xD;Flemm</richText>
