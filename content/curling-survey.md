## Who am I?

I'm Andrew Flemming - brother of noted northern curler Margot Flemming. In 2009 I combined my passions for curling and product development to create the first coaching stats tool for the iPhone, and later the iPad, called [CurlBook]({{< ref "curlbook" >}}). CurlBook was a labour of love, developed in the evenings and weekends while I began my career in a real jobby-job. I retired the app 10 years later, when the underpinnings became too old to keep it modern without a complete overhaul, which I could not afford (CurlBook 1.0 was released for iPhoneOS 3.0, before the first iPad had even been announced).

## What am I doing?

Well, time marches ever forth, and the flame that originally compelled me to create CurlBook remains ablaze. **I want to build a new product for curling coaches** - one that derives insights from data collected during games, and helps inform how they help their team develop between games; while being fast, intuitive, and a pleasure to use. CurlBook: The Next Generation? 

I believe I can make something great.

## I'd like your help

To discover whether I can create a product that is valuable for coaches while being viable for me to develop and support full time, I'd like to learn a little about you - a potential customer (someday). The survey below is the first step in this discovery process. I'm extremely grateful for you taking the time to help by providing your answers.
