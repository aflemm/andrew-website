This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in my various apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch.

# Information Collected
I do not collect any user data, and none of your data is visible to me in any way.

# iCloud
My apps may store some of your data in Apple’s iCloud service, to enable sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID. This data is not accessible or visible to me.

# Future
Should user data become visible to me in the future, I will not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish my app's functionality. I may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people are actively using a certain application.

I may disclose user information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, I may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

# Changes to this policy
If I decide to change our privacy policy, I will post those changes on this page.
