This family trip to France was one of the best we've taken, but when we got home I realized I had taken less than 5 videos the whole time. Needless to say I felt like an idiot, especially after being so deliberate about shooting video on earlier trips, and always being grateful I had.

In the end I stripped out the videos from all the live photos taken on my phone, and was able to cobble this together. A disappointment as a piece of work, but a wonderful reminder of an incredible week.
