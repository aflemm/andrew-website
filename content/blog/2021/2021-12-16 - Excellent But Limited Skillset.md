Listening to [Vulcan Hello](https://www.theincomparable.com/vulcanhello/) recently, Scott said something that my brain found very sticky while discussing why a ninja-nun character (on Star Trek) went on a murderous robbery spree:

>She had to take her excellent but limited skillset and apply it to this problem

I love this — *excellent but limited*. This character was really good at killing people with swords, and when faced with a problem she needed to solve, this limited skillset was what she had available. No matter how excellent this skillset was, it was never going to solve the problem ... cleanly. Had she been a little more skilled at making persuasive phone calls, or something similar, she probably could have handled the situation with less loss of life, but that's not a choice she was able to make.

We may not all be ninja warrior nuns, but I think this is a (the??) universal life experience — solving problems with our own limited (hopefully excellent, occasionally) skillset. I think you can view anyone's actions through this lens and gain at least some insight into what is driving their choices.

Here's the clip from the podcast:
