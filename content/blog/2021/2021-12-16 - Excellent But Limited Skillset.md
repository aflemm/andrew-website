Listening to [Vulcan Hello](https://www.theincomparable.com/vulcanhello/) recently, Scott said something that my brain found very sticky while discussing why a ninja-nun character went on a murderous robbery spree:

>She had to take her excellent but limited skillset and apply it to this problem

I love this. *Excellent, but limited*. This character was really good at killing people with swords, and when faced with a problem to solve, this was the skillset she was forced to turn to. We may not all be ninja warrior nuns, but this is the universal life experience — solving problems with our own limited (hopefully excellent, occasionally) skillset. I think you can view anyone's actions through this lens and gain at least some insight into what is driving their choices.

Here's the clip from the podcast:
