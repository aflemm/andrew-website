Good news! With only a few days to spare, I've released an update to everyone's favourite app â€” [Festivus Grievances]({{< ref "grievances" >}}). Version [2021.2]({{< ref "grievances#2021-2" >}}) fixes some bugs just in time for Festivus this year.

Make sure you're fully up to date, and get ready to have all the anger you've built up (and put aside) over the year come flooding back, ready to be aired on the 23rd.
