I don't know who out there needs to hear this, but if you haven't seen [Patriot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4687882/), drop everything and start — you're in for a treat! I've been saying since it debuted that Patriot is the best thing on TV, and as much as I adore Ted Lasso, six years later my opinion hasn't changed.

The acting is wonderful, the story is exciting, but the dialog is what really pushes it over the edge. The way the characters speak is so wonderfully weird. The odd cadence, the repetition, it feels carefully crafted in a way that just sticks in your brain. It's a damned shame it got shit-canned by Amazon, but the seasons that were made are such perfection that I'm not even mad about it. Seriously, just watch this show.

"It is cool".
