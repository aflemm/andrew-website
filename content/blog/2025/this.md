Be it "PC" (*read: kindness*) or "Woke" (*read: aware of discrimination*), conservatives love to pick a loosely-defined term and rally behind it as some sort of attack on their values (*read: racism*). The ambiguity of the true meaning of these terms gives their true intentions (*read: discrimination*) some plausible deniability.

Now, as conservatives everywhere set their sights on DEIA initiatives, the curtain has been pulled wide open. The ambiguity is gone. "DEIA" is not some wishy-washy means-nothing acronym. "DEIA" means something.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility

Conservatives are fighting against **Diversity**

Conservatives are fighting against **Equity**

Conservatives are fighting against **Inclusion**

Conservatives are fighting against **Accessibility**

"I hate diversity" is a hell of a lot more clear than their previous "I hate this politically correct climate" ever was (not that the intent has changed at all).

So we **make them say the words**. We spell out the acronym every time they try to use it. There's no mask left to hide their meaning behind. 

There's only one thing conservatives are trying to *conserve*, and that's their ability to personally benefit from the discrimination of others, who they believe they are separate from and superior to. They are *this close* to saying out out loud - it's time we make them.
