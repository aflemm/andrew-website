[This article by Jaime Green](https://slate.com/technology/2022/01/kids-under-5-vaccine-parents.html) on Slate struck a strong chord with me for obvious reasons:

>It is the awful feeling that the world has moved on. The White House blithely anticipates a “[winter of death](https://news.yahoo.com/joe-biden-warns-winter-death-070719247.html)” and suffering for the unvaccinated, but, well, that’s their own fault, isn’t it! If you’re fully vaxxed, which you of course could be, omicron will be a sniffle and a five-day reality TV binge! [The Atlantic writes](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/covid-omicron-vaccination-rashomon/621199/) of reasonable people saying they’re “vaxxed and done,” people who reasonably say “COVID is becoming something like the seasonal flu for most people who keep up with their shots,” as if everyone has the option of shots to keep up with.

>I want to scream. If I can scream, for a second? *The pandemic is not fucking over, because children under 5 cannot get fucking vaccinated.*

In a way it's even worse for those of us with kids under 2. From an [update given last December by Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-ongoing-studies-covid-19) regarding the status of clinical trials for children:

>Compared to the 16- to 25-year-old population in which high efficacy was demonstrated, **non-inferiority was met for the 6- to 24-month-old population** but not for the 2- to under 5-year-old population in this analysis. No safety concerns were identified and the 3 µg dose demonstrated a favorable [*sic*] safety profile in children 6 months to under 5 years of age. [Emphasis added]

So *we have a safe and effective vaccine for the 6-month to 2-year-old age group*, we've had it for over a month now, but we're not rolling it out because ... we simply can't be bothered? Pardon me while *I* scream for a second.

We're simply supposed to accept that our kids will inevitably get COVID without being vaccinated because protecting them would simply be too much effort for us to collectively muster. But don't worry, they *probably* won't end up in the hospital, and they *probably* won't die — that should be comfort enough, right?
