A silly app for iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS used to keep track of all the ways you've been disappointed by the people in your life. You enter grievances all year, and they remain hidden from everyone - even yourself. Keep all that anger bottled up until [Festivus dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus) and the [airing of the grievances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus#Airing_of_Grievances)!
