A silly app used to keep track of all the ways you've been disappointed by the people in your life. You enter grievances all year, and they remain hidden from everyone ‚Äî even yourself. Keep all that anger bottled up until [Festivus dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus) and the [airing of the grievances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus#Airing_of_grievances)!

I originally built Festivus Grievances as a playground to learn SwiftUI, but it's become something I'm actually rather proud of üôÇ.

This is by far the most feature-rich and polished grievance tracking app for Festivus *in the world*.
