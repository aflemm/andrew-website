I built the original CurlBook app in 2009. It started on the iPhone (3G!), then expanded to the first iPad in 2010. 

CurlBook introduced miss-types (i.e. thrower line inside) to curling analytics for the first time, and was used around the world by national teams, including Curling Canada.

The combination of career pressure, a very old codebase, and the incredible pace of change in the industry led me to retire the app in 2018.
