The [SmartBroom](https://smartbroom.ca) — developed and sold by my company Canadian Curling Tools Ltd. — is a powerful tool for curlers interested in improving the effectiveness of their sweeping. It is used by national organizations and curling clubs around the world.

My contributions to the product are the hardware design (i.e. electronics), the embedded firmware (on the SmartBroom itself) and the iOS app.
